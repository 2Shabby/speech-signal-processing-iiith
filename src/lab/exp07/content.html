	    The objective of this experiment is to analyse speech signals by computing 
	    the cepstrum for various voiced and unvoiced sounds, study their characteristics 
	    using the computed cepstrum and reconstructing the spectrum by retaining various 
	    components of the cepstrum.

<h3>The Cepstrum</h3>
<p> 
The cepstrum is a common transform used to gain information from a person’s speech signal. 
It can be used to separate the excitation signal (which contains the words and the pitch) 
and the transfer function (which contains the voice quality). It is similar to a channel 
vocoder or LPC in its applications, but using the cepstrum as a spectral analyzer is a 
completely different process. (It is also worth pointing out that cepstrum is “spectrum” 
with the first syllable flipped… we will encounter several words with this naming 
convention.) Before describing the details of the cepstrum, a little background in speech 
models is needed.
</p>

<h3>Background Information</h3>
<p>
Speech is the output of a time-varying vocal-tract system excited by a time-varying modulated
airflow. Mathematically, this can be described in the time domain as: 
$$ x(t) = \int\limits_{0}^{t} g(\tau) h(t-\tau) $$
Since convolution in the time domain is multiplication in the frequency domain, this become: 
$$X(\omega) = G(\omega)H(\omega) $$
If we take the log of the magnitude of both sides of this transform, we reach: 
$$ \log⁡|X(\omega)| = \log⁡|G(\omega)| + \log⁡|H(\omega)| $$

Computing the inverse Fourier Transform of this equation brings us into the realm of "quefrency."
$$ F ^{− 1} \log⁡| X(\omega) | = F ^{− 1} \log⁡| G(\omega) | + F ^{− 1} \log⁡| H(\omega) | $$

Quefrency is the x-axis of the cepstrum. Its units are in time. Typically the areas of 
interest are from 0ms to around 10ms. See Figure 1 below for the full process.

<h3>The Use of the Cepstrum</h3>

<p>We have now seen the process by which we calculate the cepstrum of a signal. 
It is now time to dicuss some the uses of the cepstrum. Often after having calculated the 
cepstrum, we will want to "lifter" the signal. (Once again the naming scheme has been used. 
This time on the word filter) When we lifter, we are seperating the transfer function 
(the spectral envelope) and the excitation signal. The transfer function usually appears 
as a steep slant at the beginning of the plot. The excitation appears as periodic peaks 
occurring after around 5ms. Below we can see examples of several cepstrum plots. Note how 
the female voice has peaks occurring more often then in the male’s cepstrum. This is due to 
the higher pitch of a female voice. </p>
